  <b>Video Game Programming</b> was a WSU Engineering Camp that ran 4 half-days during Summer 2016. It was for 8th and 9th
  graders who had no programming background but who wanted to write computer games.
  Games were in the style of Flappy Bird or Super Mario Bros.
  All games were written using <a href="https://www.scirra.com/construct2">Construct2</a>, free software which runs on any Windows computer.
  The games were then translated to HTML5/js and are now playable by anybody on the web in any browser.
  Many students drew and animated their  own characters. They created players, screens, bad guys and bosses.
  <br/><br/>
 The camp ended with a <a href="WSU%20Game%20Camp%20Open%20House%202016.pdf">final presentation of everybody's game</a>. Final games are now hosted on this web until Summer 2017. While campers had a strong interest in computer programming, no previous computer programming background was required.
<br /><br/>
This camp met in Building 200, Room M165 of the National Center for Aviation Training, 4004 N Webb Rd, Wichita.
<br /><br />
Lead instructor <b>John Harrison</b> is a multi-talented engineer, musician, artist and entrepreneur, who has previously served on the faculty of both WSU College of Engineering and School of Music. He programs for fun by writing mobile apps, retro computer games, and even new media art that uses computers. He is concertmaster for the Wichita Symphony Orchestra and a founder of MakeICT.  He has taught engineering summer camps for several years. John can be contacted at john at makeict dot org.
